Most of the community says VLC is a bad media player or is bloated. I do not agree with this because there is no evidence to back this up. Saying deinterlacing is bad like... who needs that as a feature? You're lucky that VLC even was courageous enough to add ability to watch live video, which im sure MPV/Any other media player can't play M3U/M3U8 files (because they are worse than VLC). Building font cache doesn't take that long, does it really bother you that much? Also imagine using ASS subs, SRT is obviously much better and has more support. Old decoding plugins are not an issue, as most of the encoding community already uses H263 as the main video codec. Calling the video filters bad and slow without evidence is not a good thing, which i am sure is a false statement made by ANTIS that have nothing to do but bother the obviously better media player.

Because FLAC introduces artifacts into the audio. Only the industry knows what they're doing and even then I doubt it. I once did FLAC and got into a lot of trouble because they were considered mini encodes. I trust what Koby from kametsu has to say on FLAC.
